My night began in a ratskeller with no klimaanlage.  
I fell into a deep Kopfkino while staring at the long white hair sticking out of my Bratwurst.  
I was back in my father's BMW, Rammstein was playing, and my father was picking white hair out of his beard as he was driving. 
Sweat began to roll down my face, I knew better than to go anywhere in my lederhosen with no klimaanlage. 
We were speeding to the Flughafen to meet Carl Gauss. 
We were hoping to take him with us to a Biergarten in Berlin, where they played wettewerbsfaehig rasenpfeile. 
The entire day was turning into a Luftschloss.
It was then I realized I was still staring at the hair in my bratwurst, when suddenly, I had a schnapsidee!
Heiliger Strohsack! In order to cure this Weltschmerz, we should put on a production of Schneewittchen.
Or maybe I'll just head to the Biergarten, find a nice woman in a Dirndel and pass out in my chair before I have the confidence to speak to her.
